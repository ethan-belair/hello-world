# hello-world
This is a trial repository for edumacational purp'ses.

Now I'm editing this file to see how the branch system works.
This will be a trial update until I commit the changes. 
At that point, this updated file will merge (overwrite?) the original readme.
Then this branch will close and all changes will exist solely in the main branch.
